![Proxylist-Scraper-Checker-HQ-v4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a2bf13c-70a2-4927-bb4f-e786d8264136)


# 📌 How to use

Input a url to scrape and check OR input a path to proxylist you have downloaded OR just type `linkslist.txt` for HQ proxylist that are updated regularly.

Everything is included to have a great proxylist. The proxys are saved to a textfile after the check is 100% complete. 

# 🪄 Notes 

    For now if the script looks like it has hung up or stopped working press ctrl+c once and it will start working again. 

    First release, many more features and mechanics planned for future releases but this version works pretty well so I released it. 


### Proxyscript.py

This is a secondary script that is fully automated to update the proxylist called socks4.txt and scrape/check proxies every 20 min. It uses Socks4.txt and another file created named failed-proxylist.txt and does not check those proxies again after first run. By default the timeout is 1200ms, 3 threads, socks4 protocol. You can change these settings in the code if you wish but they are very good as is although it may seem a little slow on the first pass.  

This script was also updated to use a better threading tecnique that I need to implement on the regular checker, so it is much much faster when using more than 1 thread.
